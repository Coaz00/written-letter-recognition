# written-letter-recognition
Letters were handwritten using digital blackboard. Velocities in both x and y direction were recoreded as well as the pressure during writing. Using theese various features were extracted and classificator was created with 89% accuracy. Later on, various linear classificators were projected for artifically created data, quadratic classificators were trained by two different methods and lastly clusstering methods were implemented both for linear and non-linear separable data.
